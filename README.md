# national_park_biodiversity
## Proposal
### Our group (Mrinalini Darswal, Nancy Carrico, Ashley Patterson) will look at the biodiversity at the US national parks
* Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity
* There are two csv files, parks.csv and species.csv
* We will import the data sets into Pandas databases, join the data by national park, clean up the data, and then create a new SQL database
